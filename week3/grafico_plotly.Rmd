## Agenda

The purpose of this presentation is to show how to create a 3d interactive graph with the package plotly

- First we prepare the data
- Then we will create a 3d scatter plot


## Load Data

First we load the dataset airquality and exlude the raw with no information about variables we will use in the graph

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
data(airquality)
airquality <- airquality[complete.cases(airquality[,1:4]),]
str(airquality)
```


## 3d graph with plotly

```{r 3d-graph, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data=airquality, x = ~Temp, y = ~Wind, z = ~Ozone,
        type = "scatter3d",mode = "markers", color = ~Solar.R)
```
